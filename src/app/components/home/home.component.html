      "When I look back, I am so impressed again with the life-giving power of
      literature. If I were a young person today, trying to gain a sense of
      myself in the world, I would do that again by reading, just as I did when
      I was young. The Book App has made me feel pretty obliged by having the
      convinience of reading books on a single tap. "

      Writing and reading decrease our sense of isolation. They deepen and widen
      and expand our sense of life: They feed the soul. When writers make us
      shake our heads with the exactness of their prose and their truths, and
      even make us laugh about ourselves or life, our buoyancy is restored. We
      are given a shot at dancing with, or at least clapping along with, the
      absurdity of life, instead of being squashed by it over and over again.
      It's like singing on a boat during a terrible storm at sea. You can't stop
      the raging storm, but singing can change the hearts and spirits of the
      people who are together on that ship
